  "summary": "Update existing DREAMONOMY static marketing site by removing all AI-created placeholder text/tabs/headings/subheaders and replacing them strictly with user-provided content one section at a time; ensure none of the user-provided text is truncated/cut off anywhere (add additional sections/blocks as needed to fit all provided content). Next content/layout update in progress: update the “Why Choose Us” section by removing the three existing blocks and rendering the user-provided Why Choose Us content in a single large paragraph-style box (styled like “Message from the Founder”).",

    "Static multi-page site built with HTML/CSS/vanilla JS only; deployable on Netlify with no backend",
    "Contact form should be compatible with Netlify Forms",
    "Logo in circular hero element must support square PNG upload: center it and apply circular mask/crop (e.g., border-radius:50% and object-fit:cover/contain) to prevent overflow/cut-off at all sizes.",
    "Home hero: rotating circular element should be bigger than half-page/hero height on desktop while remaining responsive and not causing overflow on tablet/mobile.",
    "Background redesign: remove existing background treatment and replace with a subtle, non-distracting scattered pattern of educational symbols/letters across languages (English/Japanese/Chinese/Hindi/Tamil) and subjects (math/physics/chemistry/biology), kept lightweight and responsive across all pages.",
    "Content direction change: remove prior/placeholder text and use only the user-supplied DREAMONOMY copy for Homepage + sections (Services, Why Choose Us, Our Philosophy optional, Founder message).",
    "Scope clarification: do not rebuild from scratch; keep the existing created site/design and only add/replace the site copy with the user-provided DREAMONOMY text.",
    "Content placement requirement: the provided HOMEPAGE text must appear under the rotating circular hero element on the Home page (no AI-created headings/subheaders/tabs).",
    "Navbar branding change: top-left navbar should display only the user-provided logo (remove/replacing any existing text + logo).",
    "Homepage content order requirement: Services section should come 2nd, Message from the Founder 3rd, and Why Choose Us 4th (at the end)."
