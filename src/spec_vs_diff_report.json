HomePage.tsx and AboutWhyPage.tsx now import and (per file summary) use the new single-box layout, but the provided truncation does not show the actual Why Choose Us section markup/styling on either page, so key acceptance criteria for REQ-38/REQ-39 cannot be verified from the visible diff excerpts.",

      "reason": "HomePage.tsx is truncated before the “Why Choose Us” section; the diff excerpt does not show removal of the 3-card grid, does not show a single container matching the founder-message styling, and does not show the actual rendering of the structured copy inside that container.",
