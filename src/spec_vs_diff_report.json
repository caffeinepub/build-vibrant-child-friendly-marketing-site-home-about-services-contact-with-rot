  "summary": "Diff focuses on hardening the app shell to avoid blank screens: adds an ErrorBoundary, normalizes hash-based routing in App.tsx, and updates global CSS/root layout plus index.html. However, the diff does not provide direct evidence that the requested rollback to the last known working version (and the specific breaking changes) was actually reverted, nor that all required pages/routes are confirmed working without runtime errors/build failures.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-43",
      "requirement": "Rollback the frontend to the last known working step/version so the full DREAMONOMY marketing site renders again (Home, About/Why, Services, Contact) with the existing navigation, footer, and page layouts intact.",
      "reason": "The diff hardens routing and adds error boundaries, but does not show a rollback/revert to a specific prior working version, nor does it include evidence that all required pages and existing navigation/footer/layouts were restored/kept intact (Navbar/Footer/page components are not shown as changed, and no verification is present).",

      "requirement": "Identify and revert the specific change(s) introduced in the latest deployment that caused the site to disappear/break, and ensure the project builds and deploys successfully again (hash navigation works; no blank screen).",
      "reason": "App.tsx introduces normalization/validation for hash navigation and adds error boundaries, but the diff does not identify the original breaking change(s) being reverted (no explicit revert/commit context) and provides no build/deploy confirmation. Hash navigation improvements are present, but build success and absence of runtime exceptions cannot be confirmed from the diff summary alone.",

      "description": "Introduced React ErrorBoundary UI with custom fallback screens (including a refresh button and a dedicated 'Page Error' fallback).",

      "reason": "While hash navigation working is requested, alias mapping and forced hash rewriting are additional behavior changes beyond a straightforward rollback and may constitute unrequested navigation behavior changes.",
