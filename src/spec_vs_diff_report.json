  "summary": "REQ-33 appears partially implemented: ServicesPage now renders from dreamonomyCopy.services.sections and removes the old grid/CTA, but it hard-codes rendering per section.id and prefixes headings with numbering. REQ-32 appears not fully satisfied: dreamonomyCopy.services still includes non-user-provided content/structure such as a \"categories\" array and additional hero subtitle/marketing phrasing that is not evidenced as strictly the provided SERVICES copy.",

      "requirement": "dreamonomyCopy.services contains only the user-provided “SERVICES / Our Learning Services” content (no placeholder/generic services content such as category cards or generic CTA copy), structured for nested lists.",
      "reason": "The diff shows dreamonomyCopy.services still includes a \"categories\" array with card-like items (and an extra \"Career Guidance\" item) and a hero.subtitle/extra marketing phrasing; this contradicts the requirement to replace placeholder/generic services content with only the user-provided SERVICES content/structure.",

      "requirement": "Services copy is structured so the Services page can render nested lists (sections -> bullet lists) without hard-coding content in the page component.",
      "reason": "Although sections are present, ServicesPage rendering is implemented via conditional blocks keyed by section.id (e.g., core-academic, interdisciplinary), indicating the page is still hard-coding section-specific structure rather than generically rendering nested lists from data.",

      "reason": "ServicesPage prefixes headings with numbering (\"{index + 1}. {section.title}\"), so the visible headings are not exactly the specified strings; also, due to truncation, not all required headings can be verified as present and in order.",
