# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Home page rotating circular hero/logo element larger on desktop (clearly more than half the hero section height) while keeping it responsive and non-overflowing on smaller screens.

**Planned changes:**
- Increase the desktop sizing rules for the rotating circular hero/logo element so it visually occupies >50% of the hero section height.
- Adjust responsive sizing at tablet/mobile breakpoints to ensure no overflow, clipping, horizontal scroll, or content overlap.
- Preserve the existing circular mask, perfect circle shape, and rotation/pause-on-hover behavior while scaling.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Home page, the rotating circular hero/logo element appears noticeably larger and more dominant on desktop, and still scales cleanly on tablet and mobile without layout issues.
